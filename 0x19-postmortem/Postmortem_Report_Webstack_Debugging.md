Issue Summary:

    Duration:
        Start Time: February 18, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC)
        End Time: February 18, 2024, 2:30 PM (UTC)
    Impact:
        The outage affected the user authentication service, causing a 30% degradation in login functionality.
    Root Cause:
        A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an excessive number of requests being directed to a single authentication server, overwhelming its capacity.

Timeline:

    Detection Time:
        February 18, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC)
    How Detected:
        An automated monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates for the authentication service.
    Actions Taken:
        Initially, investigated the application server logs for any anomalies.
        Assumed the issue might be related to a recent code deployment and rolled back changes.
        Checked network configurations for potential issues.
    Misleading Paths:
        Initially focused on the database layer, suspecting issues with query performance.
        Investigated the application code for potential bugs causing excessive resource consumption.
    Escalation:
        Escalated the incident to the infrastructure team as the issue appeared to be related to the load balancer and server distribution.
    Resolution:
        Identified the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, specifically the incorrect distribution algorithm.
        Adjusted the load balancer settings to evenly distribute incoming requests across all authentication servers.
        Monitored the system to ensure the stabilization of the authentication service.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause:
        The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, causing it to use a suboptimal distribution algorithm that directed an excessive number of requests to a single authentication server.
    Resolution:
        Corrected the load balancer settings to use a more appropriate distribution algorithm, ensuring a balanced load across all authentication servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Regularly review and update load balancer configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
        Enhance monitoring alerts to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
        Implement automated tests in the deployment pipeline to catch load balancing issues during the early stages.
    Tasks:
        Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations across the entire infrastructure.
        Enhance documentation for load balancer setup and configuration best practices.
        Develop and implement automated tests to validate load balancing configurations.
        Schedule regular training sessions for the operations team to stay updated on best practices and potential pitfalls.

Conclusion:
This incident highlighted the importance of meticulous configuration management, especially in critical components like load balancers.
By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined, we aim to fortify our system against similar issues, ensuring a more robust and resilient web stack in the future.
